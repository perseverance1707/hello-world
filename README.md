# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub
This is my first repository on GitHub.
I love computer technologys,especially computer hardware.But it's hard to understand a hardware such as a CPU or GPU clearly,and it's almost impossible for me to manufacture a chip.
Different from hardwares,only use a computer which is connected to Internet,I can learn programming languages(C,C++,C#,Java Script and so on) ,understand codes and write my own programs.Learning softwares is more reality and cotrollablle for me.
Best wishes to me.May you be patience and persevraning. :)
